# ruceki

## What is it?

An interpreter for the `NoLambda` intermediate language from the [pukeko](https://github.com/hurryabit/pukeko) project.

## What does *ruceki* stand for?

Bearing in mind that pukeko is the Maori name for a bird, ruceki could clearly be the name of another bird, most likely some kind of parrot. But it isn't. It's a word I made up. All the letters make sense though: It's written in **Ru**st, it's an implementation of a **CEK** machine, and it's an **i**nterpreter.
